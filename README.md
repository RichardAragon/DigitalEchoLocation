# Digital Echolocation

> **Dun un un un ununum....Batman!**

Digital Echolocation is an open-source framework that simulates the concept of echolocation in hyperbolic spaces. It provides tools for teaching AI models to detect, classify, and reason about spatial configurations using digital "echolocation" signals. Released under the MIT License, this project is designed for experimentation, learning, and extending AI capabilities in new and exciting ways.

## üöÄ Features

- **Hyperbolic Space Simulation**: Models the behavior of echolocation signals in hyperbolic geometry (Poincar√© disk approximation).
- **Digital Echolocation Framework**: Simulates signal propagation and reflection to teach AI models spatial concepts.
- **One vs Two Object Classification**: Demonstrates how AI can differentiate between configurations using echolocation signals.
- **Extensible Design**: Modular and ready for further exploration, such as higher-dimensional spaces or complex geometries.
- **Visualization**: Provides tools to visualize signal distributions for deeper insight into the AI's learning process.

## üìñ How It Works

Digital Echolocation operates within a **hyperbolic cube**, simulating the propagation and reflection of echolocation signals. AI models are trained to recognize patterns in these signals to understand spatial concepts like:
- Inside vs Outside
- One Object vs Two Objects
- Future configurations with more complex relationships

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You'll also need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `torch`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-echolocation.git
   cd digital-echolocation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üß™ Usage

Run the main script to generate data, train the model, and evaluate its performance:

```bash
python app.py --num_samples 1000 --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --visualize
```

### Command-Line Arguments

- `--num_samples`: Number of samples to generate for training and testing (default: 1000).
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs (default: 50).
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training (default: 32).
- `--visualize`: If included, visualizes the signal distributions for "one" vs "two" objects.

Epoch 2/50, Loss: 0.9876
...
Epoch 50/50, Loss: 0.1234
Test Accuracy: 99.00%
```
